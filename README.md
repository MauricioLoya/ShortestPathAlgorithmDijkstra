# ShortestPathAlgorithmDijkstra

This repository contains the implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm in two programming languages: JavaScript and Python. Dijkstra's algorithm is used to find the shortest path in a graph from a specified starting node to all other nodes.

## Getting Started

To use these implementations, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Choose either the JavaScript or Python implementation, or both, depending on your preference or project requirements.
3. Modify the graph by adding nodes and edges as needed for your specific use case.
4. Run the code to find the shortest path from the initial node to other nodes.
